# FinalProjectBigData
# Welcome to our **Big Data Final Project**, where we analyze various factors influencing traffic accidents using data-driven approaches. 
# Our goal is to identify patterns, correlations, and predictors that contribute to crash rates, severity, and outcomes. 

# ## Project Overview
# This project explores the impact of **road conditions, weather, traffic control devices**, and other influential factors on traffic accidents. 
# Through **SQL queries, machine learning models, and data visualizations**, we aim to provide insights into crash risks and prevention strategies. 

# ## Research Questions
# Our project team has divided the analysis into key focus areas:  

# - **Ashley**  
#   # Investigates whether roadways with traffic control devices experience fewer crashes overall.  
#   # Identifies the top predictors influencing higher crash rates.  
#   # Analyzes correlations between car damage amounts and injury severity.  

# - **Meet**  
#   # Examines the impact of weather conditions on crash type and fatalities.  
#   # Determines how roadway conditions affect overall crash numbers, highlighting the top 5 crashes with the highest fatalities.  
#   # Identifies leading causes of crashes and their associated injury counts.  

# - **Patricia**  
#   # Explores trends in traffic accidents based on specific months and associated weather conditions.  
#   # Analyzes accident frequencies by month and weather patterns.  
#   # Evaluates whether crashes occur more often on weekdays or weekends.  
#   # Determines the average number of vehicles involved in severe crashes.  

# - **Cody**  
#   # Identifies crash types that result in the most injuries.  
#   # Assesses whether crashes are more likely at intersections or non-intersections.  
#   # Examines which weather conditions contribute to the most severe injuries or fatalities.  
#   # Investigates how different weather conditions impact injury severity over time, highlighting the highest-risk conditions each month.  

# ## Approach
# - **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: # Handling missing values, transforming features, and ensuring data quality.  
# - **SQL Queries**: # Extracting key insights through structured database queries.  
# - **Machine Learning Models**: # Developing predictive models to identify crash risk factors.  
# - **Visualizations**: # Generating charts and graphs for enhanced understanding.  

# ## Expected Outcomes
# Our findings will help **transportation authorities, policymakers, and researchers** implement better safety measures, optimize traffic control systems, and reduce crash-related injuries and fatalities.  

# ðŸš— **Stay tuned for insights that drive safer roads!** ðŸš¦
